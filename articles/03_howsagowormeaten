🥢 A Taste of the Tropics: How Sago Worms are Eaten

The preparation and consumption of sago worms vary across cultures, but they are consistently embraced for their unique culinary profile. For the adventurous eater, they are sometimes eaten raw and alive, offering a creamy, milky texture and a subtle nutty flavour.

For those who prefer a cooked experience, the sago worm is incredibly versatile:

    Stir-Fried: This is one of the most popular methods. The worms are quickly tossed in a wok, often with garlic, onions, chilies, and soy sauce. The cooking process causes the fat inside the worms to render out, making them crispy on the outside while maintaining a tender, creamy interior.

    Grilled/Roasted: Skewered and cooked over an open fire, the grubs roast to a golden, crisp finish, often described as having a taste resembling a mix of prawn, potato, or peanut.

    Modern Dishes: As the grub gains broader appeal, creative preparations have emerged, including sago worm satay, or even incorporating them into fusion dishes like "Butod Sushi" to make them more approachable for first-time tasters.

In cultures like the Kadazandusun-Murut in Sabah and the Melanau in Sarawak, the sago worm is more than just food; it's a celebrated part of traditional feasts and gatherings, symbolizing a deep connection to the forest and its sustainable resources.
